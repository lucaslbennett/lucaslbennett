# About Me
I am a Computer Science student at the University of Oregon with experience in Java, C++, C, and TypeScript. I focus on building practical, scalable software at the intersection of AI, construction, and real estate.

Alongside my academic work, I am a licensed General Contractor and the founder of **Bennett Remodeling Solutions LLC**, where I lead residential remodeling projects from design through execution. I also founded **QuoteVisionAI**, an AI-powered platform designed to modernize construction estimating, visualization, and project scoping.

My goal is to bridge the gap between physical construction workflows and intelligent software by building tools that save time, reduce cost uncertainty, and improve decision-making for contractors and homeowners.
